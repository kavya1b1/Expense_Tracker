Smart Expense Tracker 💰📊

Smart Expense Tracker is an AI-powered, user-friendly web application to track personal expenses, gain insights through machine learning predictions, and visualize spending trends effortlessly. This project provides an intuitive front-end interface combined with real-time charts and financial analytics, built with modern web technologies and popular libraries.

Features ✨

📝 Add, edit, and delete expense entries with description, amount, category, and date.

📈 View quick stats such as total expenses, monthly spending, daily averages, and total entries.

🤖 AI-powered predictions including next month’s expense forecasting, spending trends, top spending categories, and weekly averages.

📊 Interactive charts visualizing spending breakdown by category and trends over time using Chart.js.

🔍 Filters and search functionality to easily find and analyze expenses.

💾 Persistent data storage using browser localStorage.

📱 Responsive and accessible UI styled with Tailwind CSS.

Demo 🎬

You can run the project locally by opening the index.html file in your browser.

No backend required — all logic runs client-side.

Technologies Used 🛠️

HTML5 – Semantic markup.

CSS3 & Tailwind CSS – Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

Chart.js – Charting library to build interactive expense visualizations.

LocalStorage – Browser storage to persist user expense data.

🤖 ML/AI Logic 
– Custom JavaScript implementation simulating basic prediction and trend analysis techniques.
